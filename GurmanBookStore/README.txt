Started at 4:02 PM on 2023/10/27.
Created a new project in .NET5.0 and named it GurmanBookStore and authenticated it for individual accounts.
I got my Area, Controllers and Data folders.
Then, i added README.txt file.
Then, opened the launchSettings.json file and commented the sslport.
Then, i checked my _ViewStart.cshtml file and it is okay.
After that, i checked my all the folders like HomeController.cs, ErrorViewModel.cs, _ViewImport.cshtml and _ViewStart.cshtml.
Did repository commits.
Then, Put breakpoints on Index and Privacy in HomeController.cs.
Then, tested the application.Due to the breakpoints it did not opened.
Then, continue to issexpress to get the output. At this point i got the Privacy Policy page.
Now, i commited as i am done with part 1.2.
